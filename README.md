# The Toeplitz Project Expansions and Examples Library

While the project's [lit](https://github.com/toepproj/lit) repo is
a place for strictly representing historical mathematics as originally
published, the present repo -- called "Ex" for short -- is a place to
provide enrichments.

Specifically, as the title suggests, this library is exclusively for
expansions and example explorers.
An expansion is a Proofscape deduction that fills in missing steps, to help
readers span the inferential leaps taken in published proofs.
Example explorers are Proofscape annotations that present interactive displays
where users can generate numerical examples of the types of objects in play at
given steps in proofs.
